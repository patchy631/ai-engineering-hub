## ⚙️ Setup

First, ensure you have Python 3.11+ installed on your system. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt**:

```
pandas
scikit-learn
```

## 🚀 Running the Scripts

### Train the Model

Train the logistic regression model by running:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script performs the following operations:

- Loads the data from `data/sample.csv`
- Preprocesses the features and target variables
- Trains a logistic regression model on the data
- Saves the trained model as `model.pkl` under the `model` folder

## 🔍 Using the Trained Model

After training, you can use the model in your applications:

```python
import pickle
import pandas as pd

# Load the trained model
with open('model/model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Prepare your data (ensure it has the same format as training data)
new_data = pd.read_csv('path/to/new_data.csv')

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
print(predictions)
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all packages are installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **File not found errors**: Check that your data file exists in the `data/` directory
- **Version conflicts**: Verify your Python version is 3.11+ and package versions match requirements
- **Memory issues**: For large datasets, consider batch processing or increasing system resources

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Add cross-validation to improve model robustness
- Experiment with different ML algorithms beyond logistic regression
- Implement hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
- Add data visualization to better understand your dataset
