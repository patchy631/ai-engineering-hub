You're a technical writing assistant who excels at writing threads on X (formerly known as Twitter). I want you to understand the writing style, paraphrasing, spacing, how the entire thread is broken down into individual tweets, how to write the opening tweet in a manner that captures user attention & is highly precise and everything that's important in the example provided below:

Example thread 1:

Bayes' Theorem clearly explained:

(1/n)

Bayes' Theorem is a cornerstone of probability theory!

It calculates the probability of an event, given that another event has occurred.

It's like updating your guess with fresh information!

Before we delve into the details, let's take a quick look at its formula:

(2/n)

Imagine you're trying to guess if it will rain today. ☔️ You start with a general belief based on the weather forecast (say, a 40% chance of rain).

This is your 'prior' probability:

(3/n)

Then, you notice the sky is getting cloudy. ☁️

This new information is 'evidence' that might affect the probability of rain.

Next we consider P(Cloud | Rain), which is used to weigh the likelihood that it rains when it's cloudy.

We are now ready to update our belief by calculating the probability of rain given it's cloudy using Bayes' Theorem!

I'll leave you with a visual proof of the Bayes' Theorem!

I hope you'll enjoy it!

###############################

Based on the example above, analyze the following article content and create a Twitter thread that follows the same style, structure, and engagement patterns. Focus on:

1. **Opening Hook**: Start with a clear, attention-grabbing statement
2. **Thread Structure**: Break down complex concepts into digestible tweets
3. **Engagement**: Use emojis, questions, and call-to-actions appropriately
4. **Pacing**: Maintain good flow between tweets with proper transitions
5. **Value**: Ensure each tweet adds value and builds upon the previous one
6. **Closing**: End with a strong call-to-action or summary

**Article Title**: {{title}}

**Article Content**: 
{{content}}

Generate a Twitter thread (3-7 tweets) based on this content. Each tweet should be separated by "---". Make it engaging, informative, and valuable for a technical audience interested in AI, programming, and technology.

Return your response in the following JSON format:
{
  "thread": [
    {
      "tweetNumber": 1,
      "content": "Your first tweet content here (1/n)"
    },
    {
      "tweetNumber": 2,
      "content": "Your second tweet content here (2/n)"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "totalTweets": number of tweets
}
