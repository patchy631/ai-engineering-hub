Python is all you need.

No other language will give you a better bang for your buck. No other language will let you do more.

Today, you can build AI and data applications using Python alone!

Take a look at Taipy, an open-source Python library to build end-to-end production applications:

Star the repo!

You can use Taipy to build production-ready applications. Some of its perks:

- Taipy scales as more users hit your application
• Taipy can work with huge datasets
• Taipy is multi-user and can manage different user profiles

Taipy has a library of pre-built components for interacting with data pipelines, including visualization and management tools. It also supports tools for versioning and pipeline orchestration.

It's open-source and comes with a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to start without writing any code.

For enterprise customers, Taipy Designer is a drag-and-drop layer that helps build applications using a visual interface.

Taipy's goal is not to replace web developers but to provide an alternative to those who need to build applications without web experience. If you are a data scientist or someone dealing with data, Taipy will simplify your life considerably.
