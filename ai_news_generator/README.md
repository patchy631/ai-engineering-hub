## Architecture

This application uses CrewAI Flows to create an agentic workflow with two main phases:

### Phase 1: Research Phase (@start)
- **Agent**: Senior Research Analyst
- **Task**: Conduct comprehensive research on the given topic
- **Tools**: SerperDev (web search)
- **Output**: Structured research brief with citations

### Phase 2: Writing Phase (@listen)
- **Agent**: Content Writer  
- **Task**: Transform research into engaging blog post
- **Input**: Research output from Phase 1
- **Output**: Polished markdown blog post

The flow ensures that the writing phase only begins after the research phase completes, creating a structured agentic workflow.
