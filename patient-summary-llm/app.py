                    Patient Name: Almeta56 Buckridge80

                    Age: 13 years

                    Overall Assessment:
                    Almeta56 Buckridge80 is a 13-year-old female with active childhood asthma and atopic dermatitis. Her asthma is currently managed with fluticasone propionate and albuterol, aligning with guidelines for children with recurrent wheezing. Atopic dermatitis is managed with loratadine, though current guidelines suggest other treatments for moderate to severe cases. Regular follow-ups for asthma and potential adjustments in dermatitis management are recommended.

                    Condition Summaries:
                    - Childhood asthma (disorder):
                    Almeta's asthma is actively managed with fluticasone propionate and albuterol, which are appropriate for her age and condition. She had a follow-up encounter on October 5, 2024, indicating ongoing management. The current treatment aligns with guidelines recommending inhaled corticosteroids and short-acting beta-agonists for children with recurrent wheezing.
                    - Atopic dermatitis (disorder):
                    Almeta's atopic dermatitis isx   currently managed with loratadine, taken as needed. While this provides symptomatic relief, current guidelines for moderate to severe cases recommend considering other treatments such as dupilumab or phototherapy. No recent encounters suggest a need for reassessment of her treatment plan.
