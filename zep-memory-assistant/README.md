# Zep Memory Assistant

We're building an AI Agent with human-like memory which integrates [Zep's](https://www.getzep.com/) long-term memory backend with Microsoft's AutoGen framework, enabling agents to retain, recall, and manage contextual memory across conversationsâ€”paving the way for more intelligent, personalized, and persistent multi-agent interactions.

We use:

- [Zep](https://www.getzep.com/) for the memory layer to AI agent
- Autogen (Agent Orchestration)
- Ollama as Model Provider
- Qwen 3 (LLM)
- Streamlit to wrap the logic in an interactive UI

## Set Up

Run these commands in project root

### Setting up Ollama

```bash
# Setting up Ollama on linux
