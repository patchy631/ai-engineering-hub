# RAG and Text-to-SQL into a unified query interface

This project builds a RAG and Text-to-SQL in a Single Query Interface.
We use:
- LlamaIndex for orchestrating the RAG app.
- Qdrant VectorDB for storing the embeddings.
- NLSQLTableQueryEngine to enable natural language queries on a SQL database.
- Streamlit to build the UI.
