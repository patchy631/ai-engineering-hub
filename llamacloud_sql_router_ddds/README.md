# US City Guide üèôÔ∏è: Combining RAG and Text-to-SQL in a Single Query Interface

This project creates a custom agent that can query either your LlamaCloud index for RAG-based retrieval or a separate SQL query engine as a tool. In this example, we'll use PDFs of Wikipedia pages of US cities and a SQL database of their populations and states as documents.

We use:
* LlamaIndex for orchestrating the RAG app.
* SQL to create a database and store city populations.
* Streamlit to build the UI.

A demo is shown here:
